## About
fjv4.com is my personal site, which contains information about my interests, my portfolio, and has a built-in contact form made using the PHP mail function.

This site uses [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to help create a responsive, clean design.


## Note
This repository is a re-design of my personal website, and was initialized at the 75% completion mark on GitHub; `v2`. The original site design can be found in the repository [here](https://github.com/FreddieV4/fjv4com/tree/master/OLD%20SITE/fjv4com-v1).
