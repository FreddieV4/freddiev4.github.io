<p>
Hello! My name is Freddie Vargus and I'm currently a Data Science Engineer at <a href="https://www.indigoag.com/">Inidgo</a>, helping farmers sustainably feed the planet. Previously, I worked as an Engineer at <a ref="https://www.quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a>, building tools for quants.
</p>

<p>
I graduated from Boston University's Computer Science program in 2018, and along the way, I did some <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2017/crowdguilds/guilds.pdf">crowdsourcing research</a> with Professor Bernstein and the Stanford Crowd Research Collective, was in the  <a href="http://course.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a> International Fellowship Program, and led <a href="https://github.com/bualpha">BU Alpha</a>, a Quant Research team within the BU Finance and Investment Club.
</p>

<p>
My interests outside of work are: playing soccer, muay thai, pool, learning about languages, rap & hip-hop music, and participating in MOOCs.
