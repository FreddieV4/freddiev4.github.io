<p>
Hello! My name is Freddie Vargus and I'm currently a Software Engineer at <a href="https://quantopian.com">Quantopian</a>, where we build tools for quants.
</p>
<p>
I graduated from Boston University's Computer Science program, and am advisor to <a href="https://github.com/bualpha">BU Alpha</a>, a Quant Research team within the BU Finance and Investment Club. Previously, I did some <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2017/crowdguilds/guilds.pdf">crowdsourcing research</a> with Professor Bernstein and the Stanford Crowd Research Collective, and was in the International Fellowship program with <a href="http://course.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a>.
</p>

<p>
My interests outside of work are: playing soccer, muay thai, pool, learning about languages, rap & hip-hop music, and participating in MOOCs,
</p>

<p>
If you'd like to chat about Quant Finance / Engineering, helping URM in STEM, or anything mentioned above, my <a href="mailto:fjv41995@gmail.com">email</a> is the best way to get in touch.
