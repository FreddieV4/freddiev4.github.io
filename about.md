<p>
Hi there! My name is Freddie Vargus and I'm currently a senior at Boston University, studying <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cs/undergraduate/">Computer Science</a>. I'm passionate about software engineering, and am currently learning a bit about autonomous vehicles, machine learning, distributed systems, and symbolic computation.
</p>
<p>
I'm leading <a href="https://github.com/bualpha">BU Alpha</a>, a Quant Research team at the BU Finance and Investment Club, and also help maintain <a href="https://github.com/quantopian/zipline">Zipline</a>, a Pythonic Algorithmic Trading Library at <a href="https://www.quantopian.com">Quantopian</a>, where I worked as a Software Engineering Intern for two summers. Sometimes I like to help <a href="http://contrarycap.com">make investments</a> in university-focused ventures. Previously, I did some <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2017/crowdguilds/guilds.pdf">research</a> in crowdsourcing and HCI.
</p>
<p>
My interests outside of work are: playing soccer, muay thai, learning about languages, listening to new rap & hip-hop music, 8-ball pool, <a href="http://www.bostondrone.racing/">micro drone racing</a> and teaching people about <a href="https://github.com/docker/community/blob/master/Docker%20Education/students/Campus%20Ambassadors-guidelines.md">Docker</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you'd like to get in contact with me, my <a href="mailto:fvargus4@bu.edu">email</a> is the best way to do that.
